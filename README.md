### 0. Model Used (Proposed)
1. Ordinary Least Square (OLS)
    ```latex
    Y = b_0 + b_1X + e
    ``````
2. Explanation For Variables
    - `Y` is the flood risk, it can be in the form of risk score or a binary outcome if using logistic regression
    - `X` is the distance from historical flood location
    - `\beta_*` can be computed and estimated. Generally:
        - The slope should be negative as greater distance (from historical location) would reduce the flood risks
        - One unit change in distance will correspond to the change in flood risk based on the magnitude of slope
3. Some alternative to the linear regression/logistic regression approach:
    - [XGBoost](https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)
    - [Decision Tree](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/tree.html)


### 1. Data Preparation
To create a regression model for flood risk, we require both predictor, $x$ and the response, $y$ variable. 
1. The predictor variable is collected as follows:
    - Random address throughout Malaysia were scrapped and cleaned from [random address generator](https://www.bestrandoms.com/random-address-in-my) using Python `Selenium` package.
    - The addresses were then geocoded to obtain their corresponding longitude and latitude.
    - To compute for the distance from historical flood location, the following formula is applied: $ distance = | npoint - point |$ where `npoint` represents the nearest historical flood points and `point` represent the random address point input.
2. The response variable is collected as follows:
    - The response variable is denoted in binary form of 0 and 1 which means either it is not being flooded until now or it is flooded before. 
    - A radius of about `500m`` will be drawn around each historical flood points and check for intersection, for intersected point, a value of 1 will be assigned, otherwise, 0 will be assigned. 

### 2. Objective
- To predict flood risk in any location in Malaysia
- To determine the best model describing flood risk in Malaysia
